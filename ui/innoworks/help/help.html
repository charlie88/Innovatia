		<b><i>How do I add an idea?</i></b><br/>
		You can create an idea quickly by hitting the plus button in the top right menu.<br/>
		<b>Note to make an idea you must first create an idea privately before sharing it. This is so you think before doing.</b>
	</div>
	
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em">
		<b><i>Who can see my ideas?</i></b><br/>
		When you first create an idea, its added to your private space, which only you can see. From there, you can add it to the public space, or share it with a group. Both these options are available in the share tab after selecting and idea.
	</div>
	
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em">
		<b><i>How do I share my ideas?</i></b><br/>
		A few ways. You can go to groups and create a group, then add your private idea to the group. You can twitter an idea or send links to your friends.
	</div>
	
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em">
		<b><i>How do I join a group?</i></b><br/>
		To join a group, you need to first find the group, normally using search. You will then request to be part of the group. The group leader will then decide to accept you or not.<br/>
		Vice versa, a group leader may send you an invitation, which you have to accept. You may leave a group at any time.

		<b><i>How do I give edit idea access to my friends?</i></b><br/>
		By default, innoworks restricts edit access to group and ideas. For ideas, you can assign group access through the share tab when viewing details. 
		<b>Note that the only way to share ideas is through a group or public space. You cannot give access to one specific user... instead create a group and add that user. This encourages to share with more people.</b>
	</div>
	
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em">
		<b><i>I want to communicate with someone. How do I do that?</i></b><br/>
		A few ways. The first and quickest is to send a note from the profile-&gt;note tab. The second option is to comment directly within a group or on an idea by going to the comments tab for an idea or group.
	</div>
	
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em">
		<b><i>How can I stay in touch?</i></b><br/>
		Innoworks will send email notification by default when an event occurs (e.g. group update, idea update, etc.). These can be configured in the profile->details section.
